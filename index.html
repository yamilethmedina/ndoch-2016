                            <strong>Why would people support A.H.?</strong>
                            <br> It's important for Miami to decrease the brain drain. Affordable housing could help to attract and retain top talent for the workforce. The affordability and accessibility of Miami-Dade County’s housing has widespread economic impacts. </p>

                        <p>The affordability and accessibility of Miami-Dade County’s housing has widespread economic impacts. There is now a growing recognition of the important link between an adequate supply of workforce housing and sustainable economic growth. In fact, many of Florida’s leading business sectors, including professional services, retail trade, and health care, are finding it increasingly difficult to attract and maintain workers in entry and mid-management positions. There is now increasing evidence that working families have begun to move to locations which have more affordable housing, both in and outside the <a href="https://metropolitan.fiu.edu/research/services/economic-and-housing-market-analysis/miami_dade_housing-90508.pdf">State of Florida</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Development of affordable housing increases spending and employment in the <a href="http://www2.nhc.org/media/files/Housing-and-Economic-Development-Report-2011.pdf">surrounding economy</a>, acts as an important source of revenue for local governments, and reduces the likelihood of foreclosure and its associated costs.

They are always telling us we make to much but in reality we don't; I don't bring home 40,000 plus being a single parent we have to have insurance for the children so the IRS won't fine you. We have to pay bills and we are the ones who are paying all the taxes and can't even get a place to live. We have to rent from the slum landlords and it’s not fair.
